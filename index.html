        Machine learning (ML) <b>is a branch of Artificial Intelligence
        that pushes forward the idea that, by giving access to the
        right data, machines can learn by themselves how to solve a
        specific problem</b>.
      </p>
      <p> By leveraging complex mathematical andstatistical tools,
      ML renders machines capable of performing
      independently intellectual tasks that have been traditionally
      solved by human beings. This idea of automating complex
      tasks has generated high interest in the various field such as networking field, on
      the expectation that several activities involved in the design
      and operation of communication networks can be offloaded to
      machines. Some applications of ML in different networking
      areas have already matched these expectations in areas such
      as intrusion detection, traffic classification, cognitive
      radios.
      In nutshell, machine learning can be defined as the development of itself
      learning algorithms to gain knowledge from the data in order to make prediction.

      <p> Machine learning can be divided into three parts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Supervised Machine Learning
        </li>
        <p>Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as
        spam/not-spam or a stock price at a time.A model is prepared through a training process
        in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong.
        The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level
        of accuracy on the training data. Example problems are classification and regression</p>
        <li>
        Unsupervised machine learning
        </li>
        <p>
          Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result.A model is prepared by deducing structures present in
          the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically
          reduce redundancy, or it may be to organize data by similarity.Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction
          and association rule learning</p>
         <li>
          Semi-Supervised Learning
         </li>
         <p> Input data is a mixture of labeled and unlabelled examples.There is a desired prediction problem but
           the model must learn the structures to organize the data as well as make predictions.
           Example problems are classification and regression.</p>

      Deep Learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation.
      They are concerned with building much larger and more complex neural networks and, as commented on above,
      many methods are concerned with very large datasets of labelled analog data, such as image, text. audio, and video
